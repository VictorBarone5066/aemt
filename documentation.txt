//Where DOMAIN gives the vectors of a rectangle originating from 
//gamma in the x, y, and z directions (so here, the x length goes
//from -1.1 to 1.1 2pi/a) surrounding the first BZ,  
//
//GRIDPOINTS is the number of gridpoints for the x, y, and z 
//directions in the rectangle,
//
//LATTICE is the reciprocal lattice given as three ROW vectors i.e. 
//the first lattice vector is b1 = (b1x, b1y, b1z) = (1.1 1.2 0.0)
//(these constitute the above x, y, and z directions),
//
//IDWPARAMS are the inverse distance weighting parameters: first 
//the radius to consider around a point, second is the power param
//(an integer),
//
//SMEARPARAMS are the smearing values used for derivatives.  High 
//smearing increases the runtime and can arbitrarily flatten band 
//shapes, while low smearing will result in non-smooth derivatives.
//Reasonable values are (number of grid points / number of k points)
//in any given direction.  If any smear parameters are 0.0, no 
//smoothing will be applied in that direction.
// 
//* = 'V' or 'C' for valance or conduction bands.  See below:
//
//*TEMPS are the temperatures to calculate the mass at.  Can either be
//given as explicit numbers (first number is the number of entries
// that will be written) or as a range (in the range mode, the 
//first, second, and third numbers are the begin, end and num of 
//steps (begin and end values are inclusive - 1 4 5 would give the 
//temperatures to be calculated as 1 1.75 2.5 3.25 4),
//
//*MUS are the chemical potentials to use.  Can either be specified
//as explicit values or as a range (see TEMPS),
// 
//*BANDS (* = 'V' for valance or 'C' for conduction) are the bands to
//include in the calculation.  Can either be written as an explicit 
//list of numbers (see TEMPS) or a range (begin and end values are 
//inclusive (similar to TEMPS excpet that only the beginning and
//ending bands are written, and all between them will be considered.
//So '0 6' would calculate bands 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).
